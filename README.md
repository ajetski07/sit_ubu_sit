- Complete the following change requests. Each change request should be a separate commit or pull request on the new repository, so that the changes can be easily reviewed independently.

- Using the Tailwind framework (https://tailwindcss.com/) that is already implemented, make each profile node into a card-like element, with a light background, rounded corners, thin border, and a drop shadow. - Done

- Change the current 4-column layout to a 2-column layout - Done

- Change the profile cards from a vertical orientation to horizontal, with the image on the left, and the name, rating and content on the right - I tried many different ways to get this to dsiplay insline but it wasnt turning out the way I would have hoped so I left it original. My next step for this would have been to build a new card element rather than to conver the existing profile node into a card and pass the API info to it.

- Change the random rating for each profile to have a minimum rating of 3 stars - Done

- Add a "hide" button to each profile to remove the profile from the page - Done

- Change the current hardcoded page banner image to be a separate, randomly chosen image from the http://dog.ceo API - Done, needs more CSS to fill the banner area properly.
